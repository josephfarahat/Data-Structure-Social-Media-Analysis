### The following is how we implemented the project:

1. Initial phase :<br/>
*This phase took 1 day* <br/><br/>
1- understand the project <br/>
2- start with the adjacency matrix <br/>
3- start algorithms of degree/ closeness <br/>
4- search for the visualization tool **in parallel with (2,3,4)** <br/> <br/>



2. Implementation phase **(depends on initial phase):** <br/>
*This phase took 2 days* <br/><br/>
1- finsih algorithms of degree/closeness <br/>
2- start working on betweeness  <br/>
3- visualization implementation (python library) **in parallel with (1,2)** <br/> <br/>


3. Integration phase **(depends on implementation phase):** <br/>
*This phase took 1 day* <br/><br/>
1-  integrate each algorithm with its visualization section to make one executable file (bonus) <br/> <br/>


4. Testing and submission **(depends on implementation phase):**  
*This phase took 1 day* <br/><br/>
1- testing cases of codeforces and extra graphs <br/>
2- when passing test cases submit <br/> <br/>
