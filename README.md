The project aims at applying algorithms based on graph theory to compute the centrality property for each node in the graph.The graph is undirected and connected.
The degree centrality, closeness centrality and betweenness centrality are implemented in the project.



### The following is how we implemented the project:

1. Initial phase :<br/>
*This phase took 1 day* <br/><br/>
1- understand the project <br/>
2- start with the adjacency matrix <br/>
3- start algorithms of degree/ closeness <br/>
4- search for the visualization tool **in parallel with (2,3)** <br/> <br/>



2. Implementation phase **(depends on initial phase):** <br/>
*This phase took 2 days* <br/><br/>
1- finsih algorithms of degree/closeness <br/>
2- start working on betweeness  <br/>
3- visualization implementation (python library) **in parallel with (1,2)** <br/> <br/>


3. Integration phase **(depends on implementation phase):** <br/>
*This phase took 1 day* <br/><br/>
1-  integrate each algorithm with its visualization section to make one executable file (bonus) <br/> <br/>


4. Testing and submission **(depends on implementation phase):**  
*This phase took 1 day* <br/><br/>
1- testing cases of codeforces and extra graphs <br/>
2- After passing test cases submit on codeforces <br/> <br/>
